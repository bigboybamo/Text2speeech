GeneSys Health information Systems Limited (GHIS),
Dear Hiring Manager,
I have requisite knowledge of Object Oriented programming languages (C#/Java) and experience with working across different sectors including Finance and Healthcare.
I’ve worked on high level projects, including legacy code so I’m not scared of diving into the codebase and getting my hands dirty. I have a track record of meeting deadlines and still maintaining quality work so i like to think of myself as a dependable employee that would be ready to contribute from day one.
It would be a pleasure to learn more about GeneSys’ needs, and I would welcome the chance to provide further insight into my knowledge of how the Healthcare Space leverages tech for the better.

Thank you for considering my candidacy for this position. I hope to hear from you soon to schedule an interview.
Sincerely,
Olabamiji Oyetubo.
